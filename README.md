# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

**Database Flexibility Note:**
- By default, the app uses SQLite, which requires no setup‚Äîjust clone and run.
- You can switch to PostgreSQL (or another supported DB) by updating `settings.py` (or your `.env` for Docker) and running migrations.
- See [Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions for both local and Docker environments.

You can use the provided scripts for setup:
- `./run_django.sh`: Local Django setup
- `./run_docker.sh`: Docker Compose setup
- `./setup.sh`: Interactive setup for both modes
