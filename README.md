# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

**Database Flexibility Note:**
- By default, the app uses SQLite, which requires no setup‚Äîjust clone and run.
- You can switch to PostgreSQL (or another supported DB) by updating `settings.py` (or your `.env` for Docker) and running migrations.
- See [Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions for both local and Docker environments.

You can use the provided scripts for setup:
- `./run_django.sh`: Local Django setup
- `./run_docker.sh`: Docker Compose setup
- `./setup.sh`: Interactive setup for both modes and kubernets installation

## üöÄ Kubernetes Deployment

- The `setup.sh` script now fully automates Kubernetes onboarding:
  - Applies all manifests
  - Waits for the Django pod to be ready
  - Runs migrations, collects static files, and creates the admin user in the pod
  - Opens the Django service in your browser (via minikube)
  - Uses `curl` to test the service URL as your user
- No manual pod/command steps needed‚Äîjust follow the prompts!

See [KUBERNETES.md](KUBERNETES.md) for a complete, step-by-step guide to deploying this app on Kubernetes. This includes preparing secrets, applying manifests, and accessing the app.

## üê≥ Docker Hub & GitHub Actions Setup

To use CI/CD and automatic Docker image builds, you must:

1. **Create a Docker Hub account** (https://hub.docker.com/)
2. **Create a Docker repository** (e.g., `yourusername/devops-book-app`)
3. **Add your Docker Hub credentials to your GitHub repository secrets:**
   - Go to your repo on GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   - Add:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME` (your Docker Hub username)
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD` (your Docker Hub password or access token)
4. **Update your workflow and manifests to use your Docker Hub image name.**

**You will be prompted for your Docker Hub username in the setup script.**

See [KUBERNETES.md](KUBERNETES.md) for Kubernetes deployment, and the GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD details.
