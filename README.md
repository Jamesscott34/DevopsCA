# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

**Database Flexibility Note:**
- You do **not** have to use the database provided by default.
- By default, the app uses SQLite, which requires no setup‚Äîjust clone and run.
- You can switch to PostgreSQL (or another supported DB) by updating `settings.py` (or your `.env` for Docker) and running migrations.
- See [Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions for both local and Docker environments.

You can use the provided scripts for setup:
- `./run_django.sh`: Sets HOST to 'localhost', installs requirements, runs migrations, and starts the Django server.
- `./run_docker.sh`: Sets HOST to 'db', builds and starts Docker containers, runs migrations, and starts the app.
- `./setup.sh`: Interactive setup for both modes, ensures correct HOST is set and all requirements are met.

## üöÄ How It Works

- **Login Page** is the default landing page when you visit the application.
- **User Registration** allows new users to sign up with a username, email, and password.
- **Home Page** (after login) shows all saved books in a table with reading progress.
- **Manual Add** lets you enter title, author, published date, description, and an auto-generated ISBN (starting with `JS`).
- **Open Library Search** lets you search external books, view results, and import selected ones into your library.
- **Admin Dashboard**: If you log in as `admin`, you get a special admin dashboard page with user management and statistics. Admin can view any user's books and set a referral book for any user.
- **Books are saved in SQLite DB** using Django's ORM by default.
- **Books can be edited, deleted, and marked read/unread**.
- **Notification System** allows admins to send personalized messages and book recommendations to users.
- **User/Admin Book Separation**: Users and admin see only their own books on `/home/`. Admin can view any user's books from the dashboard.
- **Admin Referral Feature**: Admin can set a referral book for any user; users can add the referral to their collection from their profile.
- **User Notes**: Users can add/edit personal notes in their profile.
