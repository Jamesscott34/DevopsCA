# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

This is a Django-based book catalogue system developed as part of a DevOps assignment. It allows users to manage personal book collections with the ability to:

- Add/edit/delete books manually
- Browse and import books from the Open Library API
- Toggle read/unread status
- Store descriptions and auto-generate ISBNs
- **Register, log in, and log out as a user**
- **Admin user with special dashboard and user management**
- **Beautiful, modern color theme and UI**
- **Notification system**

---

## üöÄ How It Works

- **Home Page** shows all saved books in a table.
- **Manual Add** lets you enter title, author, published date, description, and an auto-generated ISBN (starting with `JS`).
- **Open Library Search** lets you search external books, view results, and import selected ones into your library with auto-generated ISBNs.
- **User Registration** allows new users to sign up with a username, email, and password.
- **Login/Logout** for all users.
- **Admin Dashboard**: If you log in as `admin`, you get a special admin dashboard page with user management capabilities.
- **Books are saved in a PostgreSQL/SQLite DB** using Django's ORM.
- **Books can be edited, deleted, and marked read/unread**.
- **Modern, colorful UI** with custom CSS and Bootstrap.

```

The setup script will:
- Prompt you for a virtual environment name (default: `devops`)
- Create and activate the virtual environment
- Install Django and requirements
- Create Django project and books app (if needed)
- Run database migrations
- Set up admin user automatically
- Start the Django development server

### Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Jamesscott34/DevopsCA.git
