# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

**Welcome!** This app is a full-featured Django book catalogue with flexible deployment: local, Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. This README will guide you from zero to production, including troubleshooting and automation scripts.

**Database Flexibility Note:**
- By default, the app uses SQLite, which requires no setup just clone and run.
- You can switch to PostgreSQL (or another supported DB) by updating `settings.py` (or your `.env` for Docker) and running migrations.
- See [Quickstart Guide](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions for both local and Docker environments.

You can use the provided scripts for setup:
- `custom_scripts/run_django.sh`: Local Django setup
- `custom_scripts/run_docker.sh`: Docker Compose setup
- `custom_scripts/setup.sh`: Interactive setup for both modes and kubernets installation

---

## üö¶ Quick Start

### 1. Local Development (SQLite, no setup required)
```sh
./run_django.sh
```
- Installs dependencies, runs migrations, creates admin, and starts the server.
- Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- Admin login: `admin` / `admin`

### 2. Docker Compose (Postgres, for local containers)
```sh
./run_docker.sh
```
- Builds and starts containers, runs migrations, collects static, creates admin.
- Visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Admin login: `admin` / `admin`

### 3. Kubernetes (Minikube or any cluster)
```sh
./setup.sh
```
- Fully interactive: prompts for secrets, creates .env and k8s secrets, applies manifests, waits for pods, runs migrations, creates admin, opens browser.
- See [KUBERNETES.md](KUBERNETES.md) for advanced/manual steps.

### 4. Helm Chart
- See [HELM_DEPLOYMENT.md](HELM_DEPLOYMENT.md) for Helm-based deployment and customization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Helper & Management Scripts

- `custom_scripts/run_django.sh`: Local dev setup (uses SQLite or local Postgres)
- `custom_scripts/run_docker.sh`: Docker Compose setup (uses Postgres service)
- `custom_scripts/setup.sh`: Full onboarding for all environments (local, Docker, Kubernetes)
- `custom_scripts/host_helper.py`: Interactively set the default DB host in `settings.py` (choose 'localhost' or 'db')
- `custom_scripts/admin_manager.py`: Create, verify, reset, and show stats for the admin user. Usage:
- `python custom_scripts/admin_manager.py` (full setup)
- `python custom_scripts/admin_manager.py create|verify|test|stats|reset`

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Environment Variables & Database Host

- The app uses environment variables for all secrets and DB config.
- For **local dev**, DB host should be `localhost`.
- For **Docker/Kubernetes**, DB host should be `db` (or the service name).
- Use `custom_scripts/host_helper.py` to switch the default in `settings.py`.
- Always set `POSTGRES_HOST` in your deployment environments for flexibility.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Admin & User Management

- Admin user: `admin` / `admin` (created automatically by scripts)
- Use `custom_scripts/admin_manager.py` to manage admin user and view user stats.
- Admin dashboard: `/admin-dashboard/`
- User dashboard: `/home/`

## üêû Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Database connection errors:**
  - Check your DB host in `settings.py` and environment variables.
  - Use `custom_scripts/host_helper.py` to set the correct default.
  - For Docker/K8s, ensure the Postgres service is running and accessible.
- **Migrations not applied:**
  - Run the migration commands in the appropriate environment (see above).
- **Admin login fails:**
  - Use `custom_scripts/admin_manager.py reset` to reset the admin password to `admin`.
- **Pods not starting (Kubernetes):**
  - Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
  - Ensure secrets/configs are set up (see `setup.sh` and `KUBERNETES.md`).
- **Resetting the environment:**
  - Local: Remove `devops/`, `db.sqlite3`, and re-run `run_django.sh`.
  - Docker: `docker compose down -v` to remove containers and volumes.
  - Kubernetes: `kubectl delete -f k8s/` to remove all resources.

---

## üßπ Reset/Clean Instructions

- **Local:**
  ```sh
  rm -rf devops/ db.sqlite3
  ./run_django.sh
  ```
- **Docker:**
  ```sh
  docker compose down -v
  ./run_docker.sh
  ```
- **Kubernetes:**
  ```sh
  kubectl delete -f k8s/
  ./setup.sh
  ```

## üöÄ Kubernetes Deployment

- The `setup.sh` script now fully automates Kubernetes onboarding:
  - Applies all manifests
  - Waits for the Django pod to be ready
  - Runs migrations, collects static files, and creates the admin user in the pod
  - Opens the Django service in your browser (via minikube)
  - Uses `curl` to test the service URL as your user
- No manual pod/command steps needed‚Äîjust follow the prompts!

See [KUBERNETES.md](KUBERNETES.md) for a complete, step-by-step guide to deploying this app on Kubernetes. This includes preparing secrets, applying manifests, and accessing the app.

## üê≥ Docker Hub & GitHub Actions Setup

To use CI/CD and automatic Docker image builds, you must:

1. **Create a Docker Hub account** (https://hub.docker.com/)
2. **Create a Docker repository** (e.g., `yourusername/devops-book-app`)
3. **Add your Docker Hub credentials to your GitHub repository secrets:**
   - Go to your repo on GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   - Add:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME` (your Docker Hub username)
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD` (your Docker Hub password or access token)
4. **Update your workflow and manifests to use your Docker Hub image name.**

**You will be prompted for your Docker Hub username in the setup script.**

See [KUBERNETES.md](KUBERNETES.md) for Kubernetes deployment, and the GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD details.

## ‚úÖ REST API
A complete REST API is available for integration with JavaScript frontends, mobile apps, and other services. See [API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for all endpoints, authentication, and usage examples.

---

## üìã Notification System Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review the admin management script documentation
3. Check Django documentation for framework-specific issues

---

## üèÅ After Setup: Running Your App on Minikube

1. **Start Minikube:**
   ```sh
   minikube start
   ```

2. **Find the Django Service URL:**
   ```sh
   minikube service django-service
   ```
   This will open your Django app in your browser. If not, note the URL and port (e.g., `http://<minikube-ip>:<nodeport>`).

3. **Run Django Management Commands in the Pod:**
   First, get the name of your Django pod:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   (Look for a pod name starting with `django-deployment-`)

   Then run the following commands (replace `<pod-name>` with your actual pod name):

   - **Migrate the database:**
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- python manage.py migrate
     ```
   - **Collect static files:**
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
     ```
   - **Create admin user:**
     ```sh
     kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- python manage.py createsuperuser
     ```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Switching Database Host for Local vs Docker/Kubernetes

- By default, Django uses the environment variable POSTGRES_HOST for the database host, defaulting to 'db'.
- For **local development** (when running `python manage.py runserver`), you should set the default to 'localhost' in your `settings.py`:
  ```python
  'HOST': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_HOST', 'localhost'),
  ```
- For **Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes**, set the default to 'db':
  ```python
  'HOST': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_HOST', 'db'),
  ```
- You can automate this update by running a helper script (custom_scripts/host_helper.py) that will prompt you to choose the correct default and update your `settings.py` automatically.

**Tip:** Always use the environment variable POSTGRES_HOST in your deployment environments for maximum flexibility.
