README for SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

IMPORTANT DATABASE HOST NOTE:
- If running locally (not in Docker), set DATABASES['default']['HOST'] = 'localhost' in sba24070_book_catalogue/settings.py
- If running with Docker, set DATABASES['default']['HOST'] = 'db' in sba24070_book_catalogue/settings.py

**Database Flexibility Note:**
- You do **not** have to use the database provided by default.
- By default, the app uses SQLite, which requires no setup‚Äîjust clone and run.
- You can switch to PostgreSQL (or another supported DB) by updating `settings.py` (or your `.env` for Docker) and running migrations.
- See below for setup instructions for both local and Docker environments.

You can use the provided scripts for setup:
- ./run_django.sh: Sets HOST to 'localhost', installs requirements, runs migrations, and starts the Django server.
- ./run_docker.sh: Sets HOST to 'db', builds and starts Docker containers, runs migrations, and starts the app.
- ./setup.sh: Interactive setup for both modes, ensures correct HOST is set and all requirements are met.

See below for detailed instructions.

# üìö SBA24070 Book Catalogue App

This is a Django-based book catalogue system developed as part of a DevOps assignment. It allows users to manage personal book collections with the ability to:

- Add/edit/delete books manually
- Browse and import books from the Open Library API
- Toggle read/unread status
- Store descriptions and auto-generate ISBNs
- **Register, log in, and log out as a user**
- **Admin user with special dashboard and user management**
- **Beautiful, modern color theme and UI**
- **Comprehensive notification system**
- **User profile management and password reset**
- **Book statistics and reading progress tracking**

---

## üöÄ How It Works

- **Login Page** is the default landing page when you visit the application.
- **User Registration** allows new users to sign up with a username, email, and password.
- **Home Page** (after login) shows all saved books in a table with reading progress.
- **Manual Add** lets you enter title, author, published date, description, and an auto-generated ISBN (starting with `JS`).
- **Open Library Search** lets you search external books, view results, and import selected ones into your library with auto-generated ISBNs.
- **Admin Dashboard**: If you log in as `admin`, you get a special admin dashboard page with comprehensive user management capabilities.
- **Books are saved in SQLite DB** using Django's ORM.
- **Books can be edited, deleted, and marked read/unread**.
- **Modern, colorful UI** with custom CSS and Bootstrap.
- **Notification System** allows admins to send personalized messages and book recommendations to users.
